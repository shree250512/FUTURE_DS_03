📌 College Event Feedback – Sentiment Analysis Project Using Python, NLP (TF-IDF), and Machine Learning 📖 Project Overview

This project analyzes student feedback collected from a college event. The goal is to classify each feedback as Positive, Negative, or Neutral using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning algorithms.

The model helps understand student satisfaction, identify improvement areas, and generate insights for future events.

🎯 Objectives

Clean and preprocess student feedback text

Convert text into numerical features using TF-IDF

Build a sentiment classification model

Evaluate model performance using accuracy and classification metrics

Visualize sentiment distribution

Deploy the model using Streamlit (optional)

🗂️ Dataset Details

Your dataset contains the following columns:

Column Name Description Name Student name (not used for ML) Roll No Student roll number Suggestion Student feedback text Rating Numeric rating given by the student Tutor Name Faculty/tutor name Department Student department Sentiment Label ⭐ Target column (Positive/Negative/Neutral) 🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-Learn

TF-IDF Vectorizer

Multinomial Naive Bayes / Logistic Regression

Matplotlib & Seaborn (optional for charts)

Google Colab

🚀 Steps Performed

Imported dataset

Cleaned text data (lowercase, removing punctuation, stopwords, etc.)

Converted text to features using TF-IDF

Split data into training & testing

Trained ML model

Evaluated model

Plotted sentiment distribution

Saved model for deployment

📊 Model Results

High accuracy in predicting sentiment

Correctly classifies positive & negative feedback

Useful for improving event quality based on student opinion

▶️ How to Run the Code

Upload the dataset in Google Colab

Run each cell in order

Model file (sentiment_model.pkl) will be generated

Use Streamlit if deploying

📁 Folder Structure /project │── dataset.csv │── sentiment_analysis.ipynb │── sentiment_model.pkl │── README.md

💡 Future Improvements

Add more advanced NLP models (BERT, LSTM)

Build a dashboard using Power BI / Streamlit

Add more training data for higher accuracy
